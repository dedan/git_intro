\section{Getting the Software and Account}

\subsection{Install MySysGit} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:install_mysysgit}
This gives you the git commandline tools and also a very basic (but not too bad) GUI. On the page \url{http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/} you can get information on the software and find different installers and installation instructions. But it should be enough to just directly download the installer from \href{http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.3.1-preview20101002.exe}{here} and install it.

% subsection install_mysysgit (end)


\subsection{Install the TortoiseGIT GUI (optional but recommended)} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:install_the_tortoisegit_gui_optional_}
Much more convenient GUI and many tools which are similar to what I showed you during the talk. Get the software from \url{http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/} and install it on your computer. Maybe you need to restart afterwards. TortoiseGIT will integrate into you File Browser (Explorer) and you access it by the context menu (rightclick) as I showed you in the in the presentation.

\textbf{This software works only when MySysGit already installed!}

\subsection{Get a Github account} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:get_a_github_account}

Get an account on \url{https://github.com/signup/free}. This is were the repositories are hosted and it also has many other useful tools like a wiki and a ticket system. It is for free and many open-source code is hosted there. When you finished the registration send me a link with you username so I can make you a collaborator of the homework project \href{mailto:stephan.gabler@gmail.com}{\nolinkurl{stephan.gabler@gmail.com}}. You need this to finish the next steps.

\section{Working on the repository} % (fold)
\label{sg:sec:working_on_the_repository}

\subsection{Get a working copy of the repository} % (fold)
\label{sg:sub:get_a_working_copy_of_the_repository}

After I made you a collaborator on the homework repository you can \emph{clone} a working copy of it to your computer in order to work with it. So go to a folder where you would like to have the code in, right-click and select \emph{Git Clone}. The URL to the repository can be found on its Github page: \url{https://github.com/dedan/homework}. There you can choose from three different types of URLs (you see only two if you are not a collaborator yet.). Choose the HTTP version and paste it into the \emph{Git Clone} window.

If you have any problems with this, or later during your homework, pleas write it into the Wiki on the Github page of the repository and notify me by email.
